# Introduction:-
   
   Basically a Simple Calculator allows user to calculate basic operations such as Addition,Subtraction,Multiplication and Division.But in this Project
apart from that four operations i have also included some additional operations such as Factorial,Power,Square,Cube,Square Root,Modulus,Sine,Cosine and operations.

The above mentioned operations will be performed by entering your choices.For example,for addition the choice no is 1 and click "ENTER" key to perform the operations.The operations will be changed based on your choice value.If the entered choice is not matched with the case labels then the default statement will be executed and it will display the message “Error!

## SWOT Analysis:-


#### STRENGTH 
The ultimate strength of this CALCULATOR is it is innovative,user-friendly and long lasting etc.
#### WEAKNESS
The weakness of this calculator is we cannot perform any operations other than addition,subtraction multiplication, division ,modulus ,power,factorial,square,cube,square root,Sine,Cosine and tangent functions.
#### OPPORTUNITIES
Nowadays the Tech-based market has a huge opportunities in capturing the youth market
. And comparatively this calculator is already one step ahead than other.
